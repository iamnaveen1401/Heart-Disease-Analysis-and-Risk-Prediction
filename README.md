# Heart Disease Analysis and Risk Prediction

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to analyze heart disease risk factors and predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning models. By leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling, the project provides insights into key risk indicators and helps in early diagnosis, potentially improving healthcare decision-making.

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains patient health records with various features related to cardiovascular health, such as:
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Cholesterol Level**
- **Exercise Habits**
- **Smoking**
- **Family Heart Disease**
- **Diabetes**
- **BMI**
- **High Blood Pressure**
- **Low HDL Cholesterol**
- **High LDL Cholesterol**
- **Alcohol Consumption**
- **Stress Level**
- **Sleep Hours**
- **Sugar Consumption**
- **Triglyceride Level**
- **Fasting Blood Sugar**
- **CRP Level**
- **Homocysteine Level**
- **Heart Disease Status**

## üõ† Methodology

1. **Dataset Overview and Understanding:**
   - Overview of dataset columns and their significance.
   - Exploration of health-related indicators like blood pressure, cholesterol, and lifestyle factors.
   - 
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Encoding categorical features such as gender, smoking, and exercise habits.
   - Normalizing or scaling numerical features like BMI, triglyceride levels, and fasting blood sugar.
     
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Distribution of key health metrics (e.g., cholesterol levels, blood pressure).
   - Relationship between individual factors and heart disease status.
   - Visualization of trends and correlations among risk factors.
     
4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creating new features like "Cholesterol Ratio" (HDL to LDL ratio) and "Health Index" based on multiple metrics.
   - Feature selection based on correlation and importance scores.
     
5. **Model Development:**
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Comparing classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
     
6. **Evaluation:**
   - Analyzing model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
   - Plotting ROC and AUC curves to evaluate classification quality.
     
7. **Conclusion and Insights:**
   - Summarizing the findings from the EDA and modeling process.
   - Providing actionable insights related to heart disease prevention and management.
     
8. **Future Work:**
   - Suggesting advanced approaches like deep learning or additional feature inclusion for improved predictions.
